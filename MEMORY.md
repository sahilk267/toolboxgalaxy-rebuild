# Orbit Dash Build Notes

- Orbit Dash is deliberately a lightweight, local-score game so it fits the shared Hostinger deployment constraint.
- Generated artwork is loaded from Manus storage rather than committed into the project tree.
- The `?demo` URL flag enables a deterministic autopilot used for visual verification.
- The page route is `/games/orbit-dash`; it is intentionally full-screen and does not use the standard AppShell during play.

## Signal Switch Build Notes

- Signal Switch will be a distinct four-pad reaction game rather than a second scrolling obstacle game, so the Games Bay has clear mechanical variety without adding physics, multiplayer, or server dependencies.
- Its reference art uses the same midnight-ink, signal-lime, ember-orange, and deep-navy workbench system as Orbit Dash. The individual board objects will be procedural Babylon geometry, keeping the shared-hosting bundle compact.
- Browser sound must remain opt-in. The game will unlock audio only from the visible player control, then use short synthesized feedback tones rather than bundled audio files.
